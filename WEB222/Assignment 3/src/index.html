          <h3>Historical Information</h3>
          <p>
            Takhte Jamshid, also known as Persepolis, was founded by Darius I in
            518 BCE and served as the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid
            Empire. The name “Takhte Jamshid” means “Throne of Jamshid,”
            referring to a legendary king. Built from limestone and adorned with
            intricate carvings, this ancient city symbolized the power and
            artistry of Persia’s golden age. Today, it is a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site and one of the most treasured archaeological marvels
            in the Middle East.
